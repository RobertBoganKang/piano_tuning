# Piano Tuning
Similar to [tunelab](https://www.tunelab-world.com/).
Algorithm is complicated and will be written in document.

The algorithm is fully construct by myself, it dose not violate the copyright. However, the temperment file is copied from tunelab apps, it is under the copyright of tunelab.
## Demo
There are 2 fully sampled pianos as demo.
### Wesleiter Upright 123
[[link](https://github.com/RobertBoganKang/WesleiterUpright123); however I used older samples sampled in 2011].
